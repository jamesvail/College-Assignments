A team assignment completed by me and 2 other students. A simplified Gomoku game that uses sockets and threads (with semaphores) to allow for multiple games to run at the same time, with multiple users. Offers user registration and user login.





   1. compile the server program:
        gcc -lpthread -o server server-thread-2021.c server-thread-main-2021.c
   2. compile the cliient program:
        gcc -o client client-thread-2021.c client-thread-main-2021.c

TO Run The Server and Client:
   FOR STUDNETS:
     If you want to try this demo, you MUST use the port # assigned
     to you by your instructor. Since each http port can be associated
     to only one process (or one server), if another student tries to
     run the server with the default port, it will be rejected.

   1. run the server program on freebsd1.cs.scranton.edu: 
        ./server PORT#
      -- PORT# should be socket port # assigned to your team

   2. run the client on freebsd2.cs.scranton.edu: 
        ./client freebsd1.cs.scranton.edu PORT# socket.html
      -- PORT# should be socket port # assigned to your team

      Enter 1 to display the socket.html file
      Enter 2 to send "Hello World" to the Server, which should display it. 
      Enter 0 to terminate the client. 

   3. To terminate the server
      Press CTRL + C
